      Immigration is one of the hot-button issues in our current political climate, and a lot of misinformation is supported by the current administration. After a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/data-from-the-u-s-border-patrol-show-there-is-no-invasion-at-the-southern-border.html">Slate article</a> piqued my interest, I gathered some more information and decided to use this topic as my first foray into D3.js. It's interesting to see that immigration is currently at a historical low, with the longest boom being during the 1990's, which according to Slate, "millions of people – mostly from Mexico — crossed the border illegally to fill jobs during the economic boom." It's important to note that apprehensions aren't always the best measure of actual immigration statistics, because it can also reflect fluctuations in funding to the border patrol resources. However, as Slate reports, despite a decrease in funding in the 1990's, apprehensions still increased.
